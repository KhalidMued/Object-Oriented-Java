Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables
of different types at different times.
Polymorphism in programming gives a program the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.

- The way it works is just like an inheritance class but using an array in the test class instead of
- creating different objects for each sub-class we have.

Also, we can different objects in the same array and apply methods on it.
