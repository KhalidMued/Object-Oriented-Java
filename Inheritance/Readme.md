Inheritance in short term it a relation between Super Class (Father) to the Sub Class (Son). And how can the son class inherits
 methods and attributes from the super class. 

 The super class is a normal class and sometimes we need to add an abstract method to it, so the sub class are able to inherit from it.

 The Sub class must extends from the super class at first before using any of the methods and attributes from the super class.
 And we use the " .super()" to its main methods, such as teh constructor and the display method.
