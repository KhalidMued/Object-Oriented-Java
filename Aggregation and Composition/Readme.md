In the Aggregation and Composition, the main idea that the. The Relation between a class and a Composition class is strong, whereas between a class and an Aggregation class is weak. Meaning if we wanted to use any of the attributes in the class with another Composition class. We need to make a Copy Constructor ( such as an Adding method) because their relationship is strong.

But in an Aggregation Class, we don't need a Copy Constructor.
